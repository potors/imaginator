# Imaginator (Image Editor)

You can edit:

- Brightness
- Contrast
- Temperature
- Hue

Features:

- Full Material You
- Android 12+

This project uses only Java code (slow af). **don't expect it to be fast**

I pretend to update it for my personal uses because i feel that android has a hole in image
editing apps, the free ones are old and/or missing features.

Image selection UX feedback is missing btw
